NIIT Web Development Journey – 2025

This repository documents my progress and practice work as I learn frontend web development through a structured training program at NIIT.

Project Purpose

This project serves as a foundation for my real-world coding skills. It includes code from hands-on exercises, creative section layouts, project experiments, and challenges I am using to build mastery in HTML and CSS.

I am still in the learning phase. This repository reflects my active development journey, and it will be updated regularly as I grow in skill.

Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (including Flexbox and Grid)
- Responsive Web Design
- Git and GitHub version control

JavaScript will be added as the next phase in my learning process.

Current Learning Focus

- Semantic HTML5 structure
- CSS layout systems (Flexbox and Grid)
- Responsive design principles for all screen sizes
- Real-world development workflow and best practices
- Preparing for JavaScript fundamentals
